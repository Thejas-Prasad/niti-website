### Notes on Styling with Material UI and React:
You can use Material UI components (like `Button`, `Typography`, `AppBar`, etc.) in your React components. The light theme can be configured in Material UI’s `ThemeProvider`. You can also customize the components to match the branding of the Niti Framework or use pre-defined Material UI themes to keep the look modern and consistent.
